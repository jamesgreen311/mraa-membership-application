    <h1>MRAA New Applicants</h1>

    <p>Exhibiting Membership: Artists wishing to join and exhibit are juried.</p>

    <p>Associate Membership: Non-exhibiting artist membership is also encouraged.</p>

    <p>We use an online submission platform for work to be juried for membership. We are requesting 5 examples of your
        work and an additional 2 that show the back of two pieces, and framing, if applicable (7 images total) . If you
        are unsure about how to produce online photo submissions click Photographing Art. That should answer your
        questions. Please be sure your work is clearly marked with your name and medium. You will soon receive a letter
        informing you of the decision of the jury. If your work is not accepted at this time, you will automatically
        become an Associate Member until you are ready to resubmit your work; you may resubmit in a subsequent quarter.
    </p>
